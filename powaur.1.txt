.SH NAME
powaur \- an AUR helper with a pacman-like interface
.SH SYNOPSIS
.I powaur
<operation> [options] [targets]
.SH DESCRIPTION
powaur is an AUR helper which provides a pacman-like interface. Invoking
powaur involves specifying an operation with applicable options and targets.
.SH OPERATIONS
.TP
.B "-G, --getpkgbuild <package(s)>"
Download PKGBUILDS from the AUR. PKGBUILDS are downloaded as tarballs, then
extracted into the current working directory. Dependency resolution can be
turned on with the --deps flag.
.IP
powaur now supports multi-threaded downloading, up to a maximum of 10 threads.
.IP
NOTE: With --deps, downloading is threaded but dependency resolution is NOT
threaded.
.TP
.B "-Q, --query"
Query the pacman local database. This option lets you view information about
installed packages (eg. dependencies, provides, installed date). When no
packages are provided, all installed packages will be queried.
.TP
.B "-S, --sync"
Synchronize packages. When used with no options, at least one target is
required and powaur will attempt to install the target package(s) from the AUR.
There is no dependency resolution.
.IP
Note that the use of this flag to install AUR packages is discouraged.
You are adviced to use the -G flag to download PKGBUILDS and review them
before installing them using makepkg.
.TP
.B "-M, --maintainer <person>"
Search the AUR for packages maintained by person. 1 and only 1 maintainer must
be specified.
.TP
.B "-B, --backup"
Backup the local pacman database. See Backup Usage.
.TP
.B "-h, --help"
Displays help message and exits.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B "--debug"

.SH GETPKGBUILD OPTIONS
.TP
.B "--deps"
.br
Resolve dependencies for all target packages. If any dependencies are from the
AUR, they will be downloaded, with their dependencies resolved. This is done
until all dependencies have been resolved.
.IP
NOTE: For dependency resolution to work properly, the package names in the
PKGBUILDS must be exact. Use the --verbose flag to see more information for
dependency resolution.
.IP
NOTE: Dependency resolution is NOT threaded. But downloading of resolved packages
is threaded.
.TP
.B "--target <DIR>"
Downloads packages to alterante directory <DIR> instead of the current working
directory.
